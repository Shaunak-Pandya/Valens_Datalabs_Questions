# Valens_Datalabs_Questions
Java programs prepared by me while being interviewed at Valens Datalabs
1) ZeroMax - Program to traverse an array and substitue zero in an array with the immediate odd number in the right direction of array/list.
2) LeftRotate - Program to rotate elements of array/list in clockwise trend.

You can use this code to practice for technical round of Valens Datalabs.
